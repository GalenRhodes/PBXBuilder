 *         IDE: AppCode
 *      AUTHOR: Galen Rhodes
 *        DATE: 11/16/19
 * DESCRIPTION: If building under XCode (actually it's the xcodebuild
 *              command-line app that gets called) this file would be
 *              automatically generated and stored in the temporary
 *              build files as "PBX_vers.c". So for GNUstep I'm simply
 *              creating a static version called "PBX_GNUstep_vers.c"
 *              so the linking doesn't fail.
